# R
beginner R scripts as I learn 

My first attempts at R revolve around creating a choropleth map to illustrate counties in the US that have the lowest home prices close to good surf.

So far, I've hit a roadblock. I can create a choropleth with the zillow housing index model, but I haven't figured out how to then drop geo_points on the same map that represent weather buoys off the coast of the area I'm focuing on: Southeast United States.

The code is found here.
