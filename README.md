# R
Beginner R scripts as I learn. 

My first attempts at R revolve around creating a choropleth map to illustrate counties in the US that have the lowest home prices close to good surf. See the git wiki for illustration and full description. Link below.

So far, I've hit a roadblock. (Here's the wiki: https://github.com/lanceDamage/R/wiki/Choropleth:-polygon-and-point-errors-in-R,-ggplot2). I can create a choropleth with the zillow housing index model, but I haven't figured out how to then drop geo_points on the same map that represent weather buoys off the coast of the area I'm focuing on: Southeast United States.

The code is found here.

My second attempts at R revovle around my PhD studies (after 6/7/2023).
There are a couple files here that help me read in PDF files in a directory, convert them into text, and then create a word cloud.
